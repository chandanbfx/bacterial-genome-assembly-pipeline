# Bacterial Genome Assembly Workflow

This repository contains a modular Snakemake pipeline for long-read-based bacterial genome assembly and polishing. It uses tools such as Canu, BWA, Racon, and custom scripts for assembly statistics.

---

## Dataset

You can download the PacBio long-read dataset used in this example with:

```bash
curl -L -o pacbio.fastq http://gembox.cbcb.umd.edu/mhap/raw/ecoli_p6_25x.filtered.fastq
```

Place the downloaded file in the `rawData/` directory.

## Usage

1. **Setup conda environments** (if needed):

```bash
conda env create -f envs/assembly.yaml
```

2. **Run the pipeline**:

```bash
snakemake --use-conda --cores <number_of_threads>
```

3. **Clean up**:

```bash
snakemake clean
```
